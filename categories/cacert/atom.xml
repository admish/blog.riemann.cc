    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In preparation of the sixth <a href="http://www.blit.org/2009/" title="Website of a local Linux Day">“Brandenburger Linux-Infotag”</a> I passed the <a href="http://www.cacert.org/">CAcert</a> <a href="http://wiki.cacert.org/AssurerChallenge">Assurer Challange</a>, which was the last requirement I had to fullfill to be allowed to verify
people.</p>

<p>To start the “challange” it is neccessary to login with your own ssl certificate from CAcert.
I only used gpg the last years, so I had have to create a new one and configure KDE to use it.</p>

<p>That’s unfortunately not easy.</p>

<p>Because I didn’t managed (yet) to get my private certificate working in konqueror I used Firefox to run the test. Import to Firefox works without any problems.</p>

<p>It is also possible to use the certificate for signing emails. I really like KMail and i didn’t want to switch over to Thunderbird.</p>

<p>So I tried to get the certificate properly configured once more.</p>

<p>After all you only have to add two lines in the right place.</p>

<p>First of all you have to import your certificate from CAcert. You can login to your CAcert-Page with Konqueror and navigate to your certificate. A click on the link there should automatically start the KDE certificate manager Kleopatra. You should get a notice that your certificate was successfully imported.</p>

<p>Remeber: Imported is not the same as working/usable. ;)</p>

<p>Add “disable-trusted-cert-crl-check” to the end of the file “~/.gnupg/gpgsm.conf” and
“allow-mark-trusted” to the (new) file “gpg-agent.conf”.</p>

<p>Now you need to restart your PC. After login you will be asked if you want to trust your single installed root certificates. Pay attention on “support@cacert.org” and answer with yes.</p>

<p>Maybe it is sufficient to close the KDE Certifcates Manager Kleopatra and stop the service gpg-agent with an “killall gpg-agent” and restart Kleopatra.</p>

<p>After that it should be possible to add your certifcates in your KMail Profile.</p>

<p>If it is also working for you, give me a sign. Maybe we want to add this how-to to the kde or cacert wiki.</p>
