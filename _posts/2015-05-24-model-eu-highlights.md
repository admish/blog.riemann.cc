I wrote already [some posts][meu2015] about my recent experience as a participant
in the 2015 edition of the Strasbourg Model European Union simulation. I got
attributed the role of an ECR deputy from the UK.

During the conference, I took some notes on things I found remarkable. Altogether,
we have been quite creative to make our one-week adventure as out-standing as possible.
Sometimes, I thought that we have created an atmosphere close to the reality, sometimes
it felt like a parody. I enjoyed both!

If you have been part of the adventure, what was your personal highlight? In the
following, I will share mine with you (in no particular order).

<!-- more -->

- We were discussing the *Data Protection Regulation* and Lobbyists have been
  invited to comment on the current draft of the commission. The lobbyist
  representing the marketing enterprises played his role very well and started
  advocating for *self regulation*. That’s a classic!

- Most sessions have been chaired by two honorable guys from Germany that were
  speaking English in the first case as this was the official MEU language.
  To confront the Parliament with the plurality of languages speaking during real
  sessions, they continued the next day in German. So far, so obvious. Fortunately, I speak
  German very well and the interpretation was doing a great job to translate everything
  that was said in 6 other languages or so. However, it got more interesting for me when
  the chairs switched to Italian and French. Another day, we got pleased with
  Parisian and Marseilles French: C’est parti!

- French MEP Yannick announced at the beginning of his contribution to address
  the Parliament in French that would be the most beautiful language of the world.
  While some MEPs considered if this would comprise *a right of reply* (personal
  or national honour violated), the chair called the Parliament to order and stated
  that all 24 official EU languages of the EU are equally beautiful.

  The other day, Yannick did the same move when expressing his respect for the
  interpreting French women that would be the most beautiful in the world. However,
  the Parliament was working too slow to reply to this. Or, I was too slow to note that
  some chair stated that of course all women in the EU are equally beautiful. `;)`

- After the first days, a new faction “Progressive Feminists of Europe Party” (PFEP)
  was founded with 100% female members.

  I would also have loved to change the faction during the conference just as an
  end in itself. However, as a Euro-critic, conservative UK representative, every
  change to the left would have been hard to explain and there was no way to go further
  to the right, as I was literally already placed on the right border. The extreme
  EFDD was accepting only real hardliners and refused me from the beginning.

- MEP Niko is studying Physics and Philosophy. During our simulation, he got
  elected to be the faction leader of the [European United Left–Nordic Green Left][GUE]
  (GUE/NGL). He did his job with a lot of enthusiasm. First day, he addressed
  the *comrades* in English and German (Genossen). Throughout the week, he spoke
  French (camerades), Spanish (camaradas), Italian (compagnos) and on Friday even
  Czech: He expressed his wish to leave the faction to become the first male
  member of the Feminists Party. It turned out to be a translation “mistake” by
  the faction leader from the Socialists Ondřej that offered his help with the text.

- One MEP from the EFDD proposed to delay the Banking Union negotiations by 15
  years to rethink the whole idea. Very clever strategy. That’s [trolling] as
  its best, but the Parliament reacted professionally and did not address the
  proposal at all.

- The *voting system* was a highlight. Not only crashed the system once for no
  obvious reason and needed to be restarted (probably hacked from remote), I
  could also tinker a bit with the system. Of course, only for academic
  purposes[^whale]! I admit that I pressed the voting button of the seat next
  to me that was free. That’s something only MEPs at the far-left or -right can
  do. When the result was presented, I raised a question to ask why there would
  have been one more vote this time. Everyone was confused as this was not the
  case. I didn't understand first, but realised then that I had just voted for
  someone else. Nice. The vote we had only a moment later, I did the same and
  this time, someone else was asking why there was actually one vote more in the
  ballot. It’s like I would have predicted what would happen. Nobody found this
  weird. We just repeated the election and this time I voted only for me, so we
  could go on. The irregularity is actually easy to resolve as the voting
  behavior of every seat is printed out for every voting. However, no one knew
  this at this time. I consider this as an experiment that shows that the
  average MEU deputy doesn’t really care for the vote and doesn’t question the
  accurancy.

[^whale]: Who sees the analogy to Japanese hunt for whales that is actually
          internationally outlawed. `;)`

- Faction leader Niko could not stand the “desperate capitalist talks” anymore during
  the Banking Union hearings and started playing the Internationale by holding his
  phone close to his microphone.

- The strong co-operation of the Ministers of Ireland and UK in the Council led to
  rumours on unification negotiations. A unification would have the interesting
  side effect that according to the Lisbon treaty the new country wouldn’t be
  part of the EU anymore without further ado. Problem solved! (Tory’s perspective)

- The chair had to ask the MEPs to remember their original identity as a MEP from the
  Left (Niko again) has “accidently” changed name badge and seat with a Liberals MEP.
  Happens!

- The right wing factions (ECR and EFDD) found new ways to demonstrate their
  disagreement towards the banking union. They filed a blue card[^1] and proposed to
  accumulate the left-over speaking time and time for response for a minute of
  silence during the hearing to give honour to the now soon-failing EU.

[^1]: A blue card is shown to indicate a question to the previous contribution.
      Find details in a [previous post](/2015/05/03/model-eu-impressions/#formal-debate).

- Amendments passed the Council/Parliament that were missing some crucial words
  effectively negating the whole idea. This was noted the last plenary session
  day (Friday) and could fixed only by some generous exceptions to the official
  procedure granted by the chair.

- The vote to the close-the-debate motion during the hearing just before the final
  vote on the Banking Union was a tie (38 - 38).

- The Data Protection Regulation passed the Parliament with a save majority. Some
  MEPs from the right and left disagreed and some refused even to use their voting
  terminals at all even though the voting terminals comprise dedicated “abstain” buttons.

- The Council accepted by vote the Data Protection Regulation with not even 1%
  votes[^votes] more than necessary.

[^votes]: In the council, ministers have votes according to the population size of the member state.

- The Feminists party proposed a 50% gender quorum for the European Central
  Bank boards. The ECR (my faction) was proposing another amendment with a 30%
  gender quorum (real conservatives politics!). Other voices have been raised
  that support to hire board members on competence rather than gender. Another
  MEP pointed out that 50% is not realisable in a board with an odd number of
  members as intended. I pointed  out that the rule is discriminating inter-sexual
  candidates. The debate continued after the hearing during the coffee break
  (informal debate `;)`).


I had a lot of fun during the week. If you have not participated yet in such a
simulation, I can only encourage you. Do not hesitate. You will get to known
many interesting people as well. I’m confident that I will meet my fellow MEPs
again. Yannick is visiting me tomorrow. I will be part of the volunteers team for
the next years edition as a so called *BETA Information Technology Officer*.
Pretty sure I won’t be the only one.
