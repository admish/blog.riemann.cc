  Duo Color is a template for the static website generator Middleman. It has been used for my blog until 2018.

I tried to clean up my [Middleman] template a little that I use for this blog.
This week-end I decided that it is sufficiently clean for a first release.

Of course, it is not perfect yet. There are still some bugs. However, it might
inspire people interested in blogging with middleman.

With your help, we could push this template further to provide a nicely balanced
starting point like it is [Octopress] (my prior choice) for the Jekyll community.
