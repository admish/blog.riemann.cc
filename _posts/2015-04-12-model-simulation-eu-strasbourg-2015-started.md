### Hello everyone,

during the following 7 days, I will be at Strasbourg for the simulation of the
European Parliament in the European Parliament. The adventure started yesterday
and I will try to blog here regulary if I find some time (could be the last post
already `;)`) or [tweet](https://twitter.com/rriemann_eu) hashtag
[#MEUs2015](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MEUs2015).

Yesterday evening, we had our check-in, a short recap of important rules that have
been distributed ahead of time per mail, but were assumed to haven’t been read, and
finally the EuroFEAST, our international potluck.

So what has been remarkable so far? After the first irritation that there would
be hardly other Germans represented at the conference, it is clear now. We are
many. However, there are people from so many different countries, as well from
outside of the EU, like Georgia.

We really have to wear suits in the EU parliament. Fortunately, I took one with
me for the Gatsby party. I asked some people for the reasons but haven’t gotten
yet a satisfactory answer apart from that it would be the same for the members
of the parliament. Isn’t the motto of the EU not *united in diversity*? The
unions of our representatives seem to be an exception.

Furthermore, we are not allowed to post pictures on Facebook (I think same holds
for other social media channels) from within the parliament building. We are also
forbidden to take electronical devices with us with the sole exception of
mobile phones. Adé my digitial voice recorder. `:(` I hope the official communication
team that got an exception for photos will do a nice job.

During the potluck we got to known each other a little bit. It is a wonderfull
atmosphere and all participants seem to be hyper motivated and concerned. Our
interpreters speak German better than I do (it’s my mother tongue) and with respect
to the other people in the role of MEPs, I do not feel very well prepared.

That’s it for Saturday.
