#### Dear Josef,

my Facebook account is blocked.

I am asking you again to be sure that there is no misunderstanding.

You want that I use a profile on a US enterprise network, where EU privacy standards are willingly and legally broken, censorship is performed (e.g. Turkey[^6]), and data is abused to retain citizens of any country. They have still death penalty[^3] over there and use whatever is necessary to eavesdrop even international political conferences (NSA spying on Copenhagen climate talks[^7]).

While the German data protection officers criticise the platforms for their illegal terms of use[^1] [^2] (e.g. real name obligation), and the EU is funding research projects[^4] on how to fight the American predominance of internet monopolists, you want to make a 2nd class participant, just because I don't want to disclose my political engagement on Facebook[^5].

<!--more-->

I strongly disagree with your decision. Unfortunately we don't have means on Facebook. However, as your organisation ([BETA e.V.]) is registered in Germany, you have to stick to the German data protection laws.

I ask you urgently to revise your communication strategy.

Sincerely,  
Robert Riemann

**Update 8th March 2015**

Apparently, some other participants have protested as well. So we got another mail:
