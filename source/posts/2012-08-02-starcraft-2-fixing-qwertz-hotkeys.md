After upgrading [Starcraft 2][sc2] with Patch 1.5.0, the German users might
suffer from problems regarding the raster grid hot key layout.

One significant difference between the German and US keyboard layout is the swap
of characters `Z` and `Y`. The update to 1.5.0 leads to a not working `Y` hot key.

According to [teamliquid.net][tl] bug #23, there is a work-around. Just add the
USA keyboard layout to the keyboard layouts options menu. It's not necessary to
activate this layout. Finally restart the game and the raster grid layout works
again.

This work-around was successfully tested with Windows 7, 64 bit.
